Use the Solana SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the Lumos Program Crate instead.

More information about Lumos is available in the Solana documentation

The [Lumos Program Library](https://github.com/gaokanxu/lumos-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
